# rings_12
12 rings logic problem, solution

This Python program solves the 12 rings problem: 

"You are given 12 rings and one of these rings is different from the others, but you don't know if it is lighter or heavier than the others. Identify the special ring in three weighing and determine whether it is lighter or heavier than the others."  

Problem Source, “An Engineering Approach to Digital Design,” by William Fletcher.

This program solves the problem using the solution found here:

I used the solution from mathisfun.com to create a set of truth tables showing the results for each weighing and where to go after each weighing. Then I wrote the code which is entirely based upon the truth tables.

The truth tables are in the file “12 rings truth tables.pdf.”
